Project Title: Smart Retail: A Multi-Agent AI System for Personalized Recommendations and Inventory Optimization
Problem Statement:

E-commerce platforms often rely on manual data analysis for product recommendations, leading to generic and less effective suggestions. This project aims to build an AI-powered multi-agent system where customer, product, and recommendation agents work together to analyze user behavior and deliver hyper-personalized recommendations. An SQLite database will serve as long-term memory, enabling smarter, automated suggestions that enhance user experience, boost engagement, and drive sales. The agents will continuously learn from interactions to adapt to changing user preferences. This automation reduces human effort and improves recommendation accuracy. Ultimately, the system transforms static shopping journeys into dynamic, intelligent experiences.

Prposed Solution:

We propose a multi-agent AI system that integrates customer personalization and inventory optimization for an e-commerce platform. Intelligent agents representing customers, products, recommendation engines, stores, warehouses, suppliers, and pricing work collaboratively. The system captures real-time customer behavior to generate hyper-personalized product recommendations while ensuring only in-stock items are suggested. Simultaneously, it forecasts demand, monitors inventory across stores and warehouses, automates restocking via suppliers, and dynamically adjusts pricing based on sales trends and stock levels. All agents store and retrieve data using a lightweight SQLite database for long-term memory, resulting in improved customer engagement, reduced stockouts, optimized inventory, and increased sales efficiency.
